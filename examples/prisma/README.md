## hooks-prisma-starter

This example shows how to implement a \*\*fullstack app in TypeScript with [React](https://reactjs.org/) (frontend), [Midway Hooks](https://github.com/midwayjs/hooks) and [Prisma Client](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/tools-and-interfaces/prisma-client) (backend). It uses a SQLite database file with some initial dummy data which you can find at [`./prisma/dev.db`](./prisma/dev.db).

## Getting started

Use this template:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/midwayjs/hooks/examples/prisma ./hooks-app
```

### 1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

### 2. Create and seed the database

Run the following command to create your SQLite database file. This also creates the `User` and `Post` tables that are defined in [`prisma/schema.prisma`](./prisma/schema.prisma):

```
npx prisma migrate dev --name init
```

Now, seed the database with the sample data in [`prisma/seed.ts`](./prisma/seed.ts) by running the following command:

```
npx prisma db seed
```

### 3. Start the app

```
npm run dev
```

The app is now running, navigate to [`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/) in your browser to explore its UI.

## Using the REST API

You can also access the REST API of the API server directly. It is running on the same host machine and port and can be accessed via the `/api` route (in this case that is `localhost:3000/api/`, so you can e.g. reach the API with [`localhost:3000/api/feed`](http://localhost:3000/api/feed)).

### `GET`

- `/api/post/:id`: Fetch a single post by its `id`
- `/api/feed`: Fetch all _published_ posts
- `/api/filterPosts?searchString={searchString}`: Filter posts by `title` or `content`

### `POST`

- `/api/post`: Create a new post
  - Body:
    - `args: Array[{title: String, content: String, authorEmail: String}]`
      - `title: String` (required): The title of the post
      - `content: String` (optional): The content of the post
      - `authorEmail: String` (required): The email of the user that creates the post
- `/api/user`: Create a new user
  - Body:
    - `args: Array[{email: String, name: string}]`
      - `email: String` (required): The email address of the user
      - `name: String` (optional): The name of the user

### `PUT`

- `/api/publish/:id`: Publish a post by its `id`

### `DELETE`

- `/api/post/:id`: Delete a post by its `id`
